# @myfield/sdk Bucket Spec

This specification describes the published Local format (0.9.1). Local merge and
reserved-field semantics live inside encrypted sync content. The Worker stores and serves metadata/
payload bytes without interpreting that application data.

See [API usage](API.md), [generated reference](api/index.md), and
[documentation index](README.md).

## Published Local Format (0.9.1)

The following encoding and merge rules are already present in the published SDK.
They remain unchanged for existing Local data and callers. Local IndexedDB stores
decoded records; encryption is applied before synchronization.

### Payload

Plaintext layout before encryption:

```text
byte 0        format version (0x01)
bytes 1..4    uint32 big-endian JSON header length
next bytes    UTF-8 JSON header
remaining     zero or more [uint32 big-endian part length][raw part bytes]
```

Decoders reject unknown version bytes, invalid lengths and invalid part references.
The JSON header contains binary references of shape
`{__myfieldSdkType: "binary-part-v1", part, size, mimeType?, name?, lastModified?}`.
`part` is a zero-based part index; `size` must match its byte length. After restoring
binary values, the document body is one of:

```jsonc
{
  "t": "lww-map",
  "fields": {
    "<name>": { "v": <json>, "ts": <number>, "actor": "<actorId>" }
  },
  "tombstones": {
    "<name>": { "ts": <number>, "actor": "<actorId>" }
  }
}
```

or:

```jsonc
{ "t": "opaque", "data": <json> }
```

`opaque` is for internal/custom merge strategies. It is not exposed by the
v1 root package facade.

### LWW-Map Merge

Merge is state-based and must be commutative, associative, and idempotent.

1. Union tombstones per field name; keep the max by `(ts, actor)`.
2. Union field entries per field name; keep the max by
   `(ts, actor, serialized v)`.
3. A field entry survives only if it strictly beats the tombstone for the
   same name by `(ts, actor)`. Exact ties delete.

The serialized-value tie-break only keeps malformed duplicate `(ts, actor)`
input deterministic. Normal writers do not emit two values at the same
`(ts, actor)`.

Unknown keys are kept, so the body can grow without a format-byte bump:

4. Extra keys in a field entry or tombstone travel with the winning entry;
   full ties are broken by the canonical JSON of the whole entry.
5. Unknown top-level keys are unioned; on conflict the larger canonical
   JSON wins. New top-level keys should carry their own `(ts, actor)`.

`put()` and `update()` preserve timestamps for JSON-unchanged fields.
Deleting a field writes a tombstone and removes the field entry; rewriting a
field removes its tombstone.

### Clock

Each bucket client has an actor id. Field timestamps use a hybrid clock:

```text
ts = max(local wall clock in ms + 1, max observed ts + 1)
```

Observed timestamps include every field and tombstone in docs the client has
read or merged. This prevents a slow device clock from losing all merges.

### Reserved Object And Field Names

The root package facade reserves app object ids and field names starting with
`~`.

- `~id`: the app object id (e.g. `note:<uuid>`), written with the object.
  It maps a blinded object back to its app id without an index. It must
  derive to the object's wire id and match the local app id; otherwise the
  object is a sync error and is neither adopted nor pushed.
- `~deleted`: the encrypted Local object-deletion marker written by bucket.delete().
- `~index`: a local-only index behind `list()`, never pushed. Entries are
  `{ updatedAt, rev, deleted? }`; a pulled object's `updatedAt` is its
  latest field or tombstone timestamp.

Apps cannot write these names through `put()` / `update()` / `delete()`.
Lower-level source modules must preserve the same reservations when used by
facade code.

### Object Id Blinding

Apps address objects by semantic ids. The worker only sees blinded ids:

```text
idKey  = HKDF-SHA-256(
           ikm  = raw 256-bit bucket key,
           salt = "myfield.sdk.v1",
           info = "object-id|" + remoteBucketId
         ) -> HMAC-SHA-256 key

wireId = "ob_" + lowercase-hex(
           HMAC-SHA-256(idKey, utf8(appObjectId))
         )[0..32)
```

`remoteBucketId` is `bucketAccessGrant.envelope.bucketId`, not necessarily
the app-local `createBucket({ id })` label.

The mapping is deterministic for every authorized device and one-way for the
platform. The semantic app object id must not be sent in URL paths, headers,
or plaintext metadata.

### Encryption Envelope

Object payloads use the established bucket sync envelope shape:

- AES-GCM-256 with the bucket payload key.
- 96-bit random IV per write.
- AAD: `myfield.bucket.sync.v1|<remoteBucketId>|<wireObjectId>`.
- Envelope JSON fields:
  - `ciphertext`
  - `cipherMeta { alg, iv, keyId, bucketId, aad }`
  - `wrappedDEK`
  - `wrappedDEKMeta { alg, keyId, bucketId }`

The SDK uses direct-bucket-key mode: `wrappedDEK` is the key id and
`wrappedDEKMeta.alg` is `"direct-bucket-key"`.

Worker-visible version metadata is transport metadata only. LWW timestamps,
field names, object semantics, and app metadata live inside ciphertext. The legacy
contentHash is FNV-1a32 of the encoded plaintext and remains a visible fingerprint;
this release preserves it for compatibility.

### Bucket Keys

The authorization callback provides a bucket access grant. Its envelope wraps
a raw 256-bit bucket key to the instance wrapping key using ECDH P-256,
HKDF-SHA-256, and AES-GCM-256.

The SDK derives:

- payload key: raw key imported as non-extractable AES-GCM-256 key.
- object-id key: HKDF/HMAC key described above.

Raw key bytes are zeroed after derivation.

### Sync Behavior Relevant To Format

The worker is a relay: it never decrypts payloads, but lists current
heads by wire id (`GET objects:index` snapshot plus `GET feed`).

Each object syncs as `pull current -> merge -> CAS push`, retrying on CAS
conflict and re-creating it from local state on a remote miss.

A sync pass:

1. Read `objects:index`; if `hasMoreFeed`, read `feed` from its `feedCursor`
   (or from the start) until a page returns `hasMore: false` or the cursor stops
   advancing. Later entries win. No cursor is persisted.
2. Sync each local object (not `~index`) that changed remotely, is dirty,
   or is missing from the result.
3. For each unknown wire id, decrypt the payload, read `~id`, and sync it.
   Unresolved IDs are skipped at the same version for this client's lifetime;
   failed attempts that throw may retry on a later pass.
